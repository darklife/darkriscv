## AVNET Microboard LX9

The old AVNET Microboard LX9 is my preferred development board because is
small, easy to connect to the development environment and very complete,
with integrated JTAG, USB/serial and Ethernet! 

The board includes:

- a XC6SLX9 FPGA w/ 324 pins (XC6SLX9-2CSG324C)
- lots of clocks: 40MHz, 66MHz and 100MHz
- on-board USB/serial (CP2102)
- on-board JTAG (Atmel AT90USB162)
- on-board SPI FLASH (N25Q128)
- on-board 10/100Mbps ethernet PHY (DP83484J)
- on-board DDR (MT46H32M16LFBF5)
- four LEDs (4xLEDs)
- switchs (4) and uses-button (1)
- some few GPIO pins (2x PMOD)
