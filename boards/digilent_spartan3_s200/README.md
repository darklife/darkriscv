## Digilent Spartan3 S200

The old Digilent Spartan3 S200 is a very popular development board based in
the XC3S200 FPGA, which use the old, but popular LUT4 technology, and
include lots of anscient peripherals, such as:

- a XC3S200 FPGA w/ 256 pins
- lots of clocks: 50MHz oscillator
- socket for an extra oscillator
- on-board RS232 converter ***
- on-board VGA interface
- on-board PS2 interface
- on-board Xilinx Serial FLASH
- on-board SRAM (static SRAM)
- 4x 8-segment displays
- 8 LEDs
- 8 on/off switches 
- 4 switches
- lots of GPIO pins

*** note: due to the old RS232 nature, it is recommended use 9600bps!
