## AVNET Microboard LX9

The old AVNET Microboard LX9 is my preferred development board because is
small, easy to connect to the development environment and very complete,
with integrated JTAG, USB/serial and Ethernet! 

The board includes:

- a XC6SLX9 FPGA w/ 324 pins
- lots of clocks: 40MHz, 66MHz and 100MHz
- on-board USB/serial (CP2102)
- on-board JTAG
- on-board SPI FLASH
- on-board 10/100Mbps ethernet PHY
- on-board DDR
- four LEDs
- some few GPIO pins
