## PISWORDS RS485 LX9

The Piswords RS485 LX9* is a very interesting chinese board that
include lots of interesting features:

- a XC6SLX9 FPGA w/ 144 pins (TQFP!)
- 50MHz clock
- RS232 serial
- RS485 serial (of course)
- 16MB SPI FLASH
- eigth LEDs
- four keys
- lots of GPIO pins
- 128-byte I2C EEPROM (I guess)

As observed, the main board focus in around RS485 applications, where is
possible connect multiple boards in the same network and control lots of
IOs.

*note: the boad in fact is named "core board" or "demo board", but for some
unknown reason we know this board as "rs485 board" here.
