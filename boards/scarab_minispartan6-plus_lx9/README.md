## SCARAB miniSpartan6-plus LX9

[miniSpartan6-plus on github](https://github.com/scarabhardware/miniSpartan6-plus)
* The Spartan6 LX9 FPGA from Xilinx , one of the best FPGAs on the market.
* An on-board USB JTAG Programmer to power and program your FPGA with any open source programmer, like the one inside our own Scarab IDE .
* An on board USB interface that powers the board and allows communication with the PC at speeds up to 480Mbps . (That's fast enough to make a logic analyzer. * Check our website for updates on projects and tutorials).
* An on-board HDMI port . Instead of using VGA output on your projects, now you can go HDMI.
* An 8-channel analog to digital converter running at 1 MSPS with 8 bit resolution. So you can start connecting real world sensors to your FPGA kit.
* Memory: 32MB of SDRAM, 64Mbit of SPI Flash and a microSD card interface .
* A stereo audio output jack using 1-bit sigma-delta DAC to start playing your music.
* 24 Digital I/O pins .
* 8 LEDs.

## Pins Config:
The UART is connected to Port2 of FT2232.
Generally, It is recognized as **ttyUSB1** in Linux.
You can directly use USB to complete the test of UART and other function without a separate hardware module.

## Build && Install:
### Check and Config your Toolchain Path:
``` Makefile
# src/Makefile
CROSS = riscv32-unknown-elf
CCPATH = /opt/riscv32-gcc/bin
```

### Add ISE to your PATH:
``` shell
source <Your ISE Installation Directory>/settings64.sh
```

### Top Makefile:
 	ICARUS and ISE may conflict in $PATH, So when generating bitstream file, compile src without Icarus.
``` Makefile
install:
	make -C src all #Add This Line
	make -C boards install
```

### Build:
``` shell
make install BOARD=scarab_minispartan6-plus_lx9 <CROSS=riscv32-unknown-elf CCPATH=/opt/riscv/bin/ ARCH=rv32i/e HARVARD=1>
```

### Download Bitstream:
You can use [xc3slog](http://xc3sprog.sourceforge.net/) to load and run or download bitstream files to FLASH.

You can also use the graphical tool [miniSProg](https://github.com/vgegok/miniSProg) to easily download bitstream files.
